# How to add a Reflection

Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. You will be expected to complete a reflection for each challenge in Phase 0. It will help you learn how you learn, give opportunities for sharing resources, and help your instructors gauge your progress. Reflections are for you, but they will also be read by others, so make sure to write for an audience. 

**Writing reflections for each challenge is mandatory.**

## Learning Competencies

1. Use GitHub to fork and edit gists
2. Write reflections in markdown or HTML

## Directions

### 1. Fork [this gist](https://gist.github.com/dbc-challenges/83e529e4c416967a0dde/)
You will complete your reflections for week 1 using one gist that contains multiple files.(One for each reflection). 

* In the top right of the page, you should have a button that says "fork." Click it. 
* Now you should see the exact same file, but at the top it should say [USERNAME]/0_week_1_reflections.md. This is your reflection file, and it is located in your github account under "gists."

### 2. Edit the reflections file

You will be learning HTML this week, but these files have a `.md` extension. Do you know what that stands for? It stands for markdown, which is a text-to-HTML conversion tool.  If you would rather write in HTML, you can do that by editing the file extension. 

At the top of the page you should see a series of buttons, including "edit" and "delete." Click the "Edit" button to modify the gist. Navigate to the file named `1_git_github.md` and answer the reflection questions there. 

**NOTE: DO NOT click the delete button unless you want to lose all of your work. If you accidentally do this, you will need to re-fork and start over.**
