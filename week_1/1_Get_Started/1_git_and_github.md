# Git and GitHub 

## Learning Competencies
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1.  Outline how to:
    * Set up git on your computer
    * Generate and install SSH keys on your computer
    * Download the GitHub App
2. Describe GitHub
3. Compare git and GitHub
4. Explain what version control does


## Directions

### 1. Setup git and GitHub

Have you signed up for [GitHub](http://www.github.com) yet? If not, [sign up here](http://www.github.com). Then follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)  to install git and set up SSH keys. 

#### A. Username

I'm sure you've chosen an excellent and memorable username for GitHub, so don't forget it! When you see "[USERNAME]" in this guide, replace it with your username. For example, my username is "rmw".  So "github.com/**[USERNAME]**" becomes "github.com/**rmw**".


#### B. Install the GitHub App

Download the GitHub desktop application.

- [Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
- [Windows](http://windows.github.com/)

*Note: if you are using Linux, you'll need to use the command line for Git. We will have instructions for this later.*
