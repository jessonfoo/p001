# U1.W3: JavaScript Variables and Object Types


## Learning Competencies
1. Define local variables in JavaScript
2. Create objects of different types in JavaScript
3. Create and add objects to an array in JavaScript
4. Use pre-written tests to drive development

## Summary
Now that you have had a bit of fun with JavaScript in the [Code Combat](../1_code_combat) 
challenge, you will want to learn a bit more about how JavaScript works. Before working 
on this challenge, read through [object_types](../reading_material/object_types.md) and 
[JavaScript Intro](../reading_material/javascript_intro_lab). Make sure to practice as 
you go. You can open a new sublime file and run it in your terminal with node.js. 
This will help to solidify your knowledge. By the way, this would be a cool thing to pair on. 
If you read with your pair and practice as you go, you may learn the concepts a bit better.  

In this challenge you will be creating a series of variables. The values of the variables 
will be different types of JavaScript objects.

You will find driver code (code that returns `true` or `false` when it runs in your [my_solutions.js](my_solutions.js) file. Run the code in this file either from the command line 
using Node.js or by pasting the code of this entire file into your browser console. All tests will log `true` in the console when they pass--`false`, otherwise.

The tests will tell you what to do next.  Run the code and read the message explaining 
why the code couldn't be run or why the test failed.  The first step is going be to make 
the first test pass.  Then make the second test pass, and so on.

Hint: If you get an error message that says something like ...

`ReferenceError: secretNumber is not defined`, try declaring a variable with that name (e.g., `secretNumber`).

## Directions

###1. Test-Driven Development
This is your first introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD). In this challenge, you will be dependent upon the provided driver code to guide your coding. Read [The Newbie's Guide to Test-Driven Development](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-newbies-guide-to-test-driven-development--net-13835) to learn more about TDD if you're interested. 

First run your `my_solution.js` file in this directory and read the error message, then hypothesize about what you need to write to fix it.

###2. Pseudocode
Write specific and write step-by-step ideas to pass each test in code-like English. Each line should be something you can easily translate into code. For help with writing pseudocode, take a look at this [pseudocode standard](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html) example. 


###3. Initial Solution
Turn your pseudocode into code by translating each step into code. If your pseudocode is not easy to implement, modify it, and re-attempt to code it. If you are missing a step, be sure to add it to your pseudocode and then try to implement it. When your code passes the test, move on to the next test. 

###4. Refactor
When all the error messages are passing, go back and check each solution. Ask yourself:
- Are the variable names you've chosen clear? (see [Tips for Naming Variables](http://www.makinggoodsoftware.com/2009/05/04/71-tips-for-naming-variables/))
- Is the code concise (but readable)? See [JavaScript: Condensed Code vs. Readability](http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-short-code) *Don't expect yourself to understand each part of the JavaScript, rather, compare the examples*  
- Is the code [D.R.Y](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Don't_Repeat_Yourself)? 

If you can't think of a way to improve your code, write why you think it's great instead. Do not simply copy the initial solution or leave this section blank.

###5. Edit your forked gist
Now that you've done all this work, don't forget to sync your changes using the github desktop application!

Make sure to edit line 1 to reflect whether you worked on the challenge on your own or with a pair. If you worked with a pair, make sure to put his/her name!

## Reflect
In the reflection section of the gist, reflect on your learning. Use the [reflection guidelines](../reflection_guidelines.md) to guide your reflection. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!***

## Review others' Reflections/Solutions. 
In the reflection section of your 'my_solution.js` file, reflect on your learning. Use the [reflection guidelines](../reflection_guidelines.md).. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!***


Leave a comment telling the student what they did well and can do better next time with regard to the pseudocode and reflection. Be kind, specific and actionable. (You are expected to leave at least two comments for this challenge). *NOTE: Forks will only appear when at least one fork has been created.*
