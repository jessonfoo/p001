# U1.W3: Create Your Own Code Combat Mission!

## Learning Competencies
1. Define local variables in JavaScript
2. Create, add properties to, delete properties from, and access values from JavaScript Object literals
3. BONUS: Integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display and manipulate objects


## Directions
You now have some practice with JavaScript so let's get creative with it. In this challenge, you are not expected to create a real, working mission on Code Combat, rather, we want you to have fun thinking up a simple mission and make some basic objects and functions to manipulate those objects. You don't need to visit Code Combat to do this, just write out your solution in the `my_solution.js` file. The end is up to you. 

Here are some tips for how to think up this challenge. 
1. Create a couple objectives (refer to the code combat mission objectives to tailor these to your mission)
2. Hover over the `this` in the code section of any mission. What is it referring to? An object? A function? What kinds of attributes do you want to add to your objects? Create your objects in JavaScript
3. Think of the methods that are necessary to manipulate your objects and add them to your objects.  

When you feel finished, you should edit your gist with each section and be done. It's difficult to know when you are finished with a project, so we want to reiterate that it's up to you how much you want to do with this project. If you are having fun, keep working and solidifying your understanding. If you're bored and feel like you've gotten enough out of it, it's good to be finished. 


###1. Pseudocode
List out the steps you need to complete to complete the challenge.  Write these in plain english and save them as comments. 

*NOTE: Make sure your pseudocode is broken down to easily implementable steps.*

###2. Initial Solution
Turn your pseudocode into code by translating each step into code. If your pseudocode is not easy to implement, modify it, and re-attempt to code it. Your functions don't have to work perfectly, but think about how to display something like movement using data structures. Again, your code doesn't have to be perfectly functional. Try writing your functions to the best of your ability. 

###3. Refactored Solution
When you get to the point that your objects and functions are working as well as you want, ask yourself:
- Are the variable names you've chosen clear?
- Is the code concise (but readable)?
- Is the code [D.R.Y](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Don't_Repeat_Yourself)? 

If you think of a way to improve your code through refactoring, write why you think it's great instead. Do not simply copy the initial solution or leave this section blank, you need to justify the omission of refactoring.

###4. BONUS!
Add your JavaScript objects to an HTML page. Use CSS to make it pretty. What about ascii art? Then look up how to manipulate objects on a page with JavaScript using your functions...

## Reflect
In the reflection section of the gist, reflect on your learning. Use the [reflection guidelines](../reflection_guidelines.md) to guide your reflection. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!***


##Review other's solutions
[Review others' solutions](../reviewing_solutions.md) by leaving an issue telling the student what they did well and can do better next time. Be kind, specific and actionable. (You are expected to leave at least two comments for this challenge). *NOTE: Forks will only appear when at least one fork has been created.*
