# U1.W3: GPS 1.2 - JavaScript

**DO NOT READ THROUGH OR ATTEMPT THIS CHALLENGE BEFORE YOUR GUIDED PAIRING SESSION**

## Learning Objectives
1. Create and manipulate objects in JavaScript
2. Use functions in JavaScript
3. Debug using Node's error messages


## Background
Aside from being totally awesome developers-in-training, you're also up-and-coming movie 
agents waiting to sign your first big star! 

You're gonna make it big in this business, so it'd be a good idea to create a way to
MANAGE ALL OF YOUR CLIENTS. We've compiled a list of things we want to be able to manage, and 
it just so happens we can use JavaScript to handle this. Let's get to work!

It's a rough industry, so to get things started, both you and your partner 
each get one freebie. You get to sign ANY actor/actress, so choose wisely!

##Directions
#### 1. "You signed...Who?!"
Thinking in Javascript, let's find a way to store information for our two freebie clients. I want to know the following about each client:
  - Name
  - Age
  - Quote (your favorite, or just make one up!)

#### 2. "Here they come!"
The following actors heard about your growing clientele, and want in! Create Objects for the following
individuals, and now that we have a growing list of clients, lets store them all in some kind of list!

  Name: Adam Sandler<br>
  Age: 47<br>
  Quote: "That's your home! Are you too good for your home?!"<br>
  
  Name: Kristen Bell<br>
  Age: 33<br>
  Quote: "Do you wanna build a snowman?"<br>
  
  Name: Jim Carrey<br>
  Age: 52<br>
  Quote: "...So you're telling me there's a chance? YEAH!"<br>
   
#### 3. "Time is Money"
Well done! But we seem to be repeating ourselves quite a bit when creating our client Objects.
Let's find a more efficient way to do this!

*HINT* Creating new clients is something we plan to do often... What do we usually do with code that we want to reuse often?

If done correctly, the following test code should pass! Examine each, and ask questions if anything looks new! 

```javascript
var shooterMcGavin = new Client("Shooter McGavin", 48, "Just stay out of my way... or you'll pay. Listen to what I say.");
shooterMcGavin.constructor === Client;
shooterMcGavin.age === 48;
shooterMcGavin.quote === "Just stay out of my way... or you'll pay. Listen to what I say.";

```

#### 4. "Show 'em off!" 
You've done an incredible job making a names for yourselves! Now that you have all these clients, 
create a way to display each of them with their respective properties, and make it look nice!

#### 5. Bonus
Now that you're just as awesome at Javascript as you are in wrangling Hollywood talent,
try adding something new to your system! Want to manage something new from your clientele?
Or maybe a way to display/advertise your business? Get in there and Code with the Stars!
