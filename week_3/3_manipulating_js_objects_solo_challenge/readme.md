# U1.W3: Manipulating JavaScript Objects Solo Challenge

**This is a solo challenge. Refer to the [solo challenge](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/solo_challenges.md) guidelines in the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/).**

## Learning Competencies
1. Define local variables in JavaScript
2. Create, add properties to, delete properties from, and access values from JavaScript Object literals
3. Use pre-written tests to drive development


## Directions
This is the process you should go through every time you work on a challenge.

1. Run the tests
2. Write pseudocode
3. Create a passing solution
4. Refactor
5. Reflect 


In this challenge you will work with the following JavaScript object that has been assigned to the variable terah.

```javascript
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
```

You will find driver code in the gist you forked. Run the code either
from the command line using Node.js or by pasting the code of this
entire file into your browser console.  All tests will log `true`
in the console when they pass--`false`, otherwise.

Follow the steps below to make the tests pass and complete the challenge.  
The order of the steps corresponds to the order of the tests.  After completing 
each step, run your code to be certain that the next test has passed.

When all of the tests have passed, your final `terah` object will be logged to the console.


1. Define a variable adam and use object literal notation to assign this variable 
   the value of a JavaScript Object object with no properties.

2. Give adam a name property with the value "Adam".

3. Add a spouse property to terah and assign it the value of adam.

4. Change the value of the terah weight property to 125.

5. Remove the eyeColor property from terah.

6. Add a spouse property to adam and assign it the value of terah.

7. Add a children property to terah and and use object literal notation to assign 
   this variable the value of a JavaScript Object object with no properties

8. Add a carson property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
  the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Carson".

9. Add a carter property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
   the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Carter".

10. Add a colton property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
    the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Colton".

11. Add a children property to adam and assign it the value of terah children.



###1. Pseudocode
After you run the file, write pseudocode for passing the first failing test in the pseudocode section of the gist. Write pseudocude using the tips on style in calpoly's [pseudocode standard](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html). Make sure your pseudocode is broken down to easily implementable steps.

###2. Initial Solution
Turn your pseudocode into code by translating each step into code until the test passes. Then move on to the next test.

###3. Edit your gist
Make sure to put everything (pseudocode, initial solution, refactored solution) in your gist!  


##Reflect
In the reflection section of your 'my_solution.js` file, reflect on your learning. Use the [reflection guidelines](../reflection_guidelines.md). ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!***
