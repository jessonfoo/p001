# U1.W2: Technical Blog

## Learning Competencies
- Compare CSS concepts to determine the differences
- Explain how and when to use CSS concepts


## Summary:
Writing blogs on technical subjects is something that will help you solidify your learning and start getting integrated in the community. 

## Release 0: Copy your blog template
Create a new HTML file and use the date to name it `week2_technical.html`. Copy the code from your `blog_template.html`.

## Release 1: Select a Topic
Research one of the following topics:

- What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
- What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
- What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning? 
- What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?

## Release 2: Blog!
Write a blog post that teaches others how and when to use each thing. There is no length requirement, but it should show off the knowledge you gained this week. You should show examples of code and screen shots to help teach others!

**HINT:** Intend your blog for a non-technical audience. Imagine explaining to a non-technical friend, for instance. Try to take a person step-by-step through understanding one of the topics above.


## Release 3: Publish
Link to your post from `index.html` so people can navigate to your page from your site's index. 

Make sure the index of your site is maintained, nice, and professional. This is your face in the online community, so make it nice!

## Release 4: Share!

Share your blog on the google+ community under "Blog Posts!" Read others and see if you agree or disagree. Start a discussion on this topic.  Consider sharing your blog post on Reddit as well.
